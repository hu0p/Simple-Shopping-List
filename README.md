# Simple Shopping List App

I built this application to practice writing full-stack applications. Ultimately, it's a shopping list component with basic create, read, update and delete functionality. The data is persistent over time as it's stored in a MongoDB database.

The back-end is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The front-end is built using React.
